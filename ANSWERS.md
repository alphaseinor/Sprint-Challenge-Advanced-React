- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Not sure there are any, sorry... functional components seem to be more favorable from a readability perspective, and I can't see anything at the moment that would cause me to chose a class component over a functional component at this time (possibly in the future?). Maybe preferred by the company I get hired on with?

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

Mounting - where the component is loaded into the DOM
Updating - where the component updates based on state or useEffect
Unmounting - where the component is removed from the DOM

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

it's to allow proprietary behavior, or in our darkmode's example to facilitate the linking of state and local storage

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

to make sure the system is working and find bugs before launching the application.
